# variable-bits
An experiment in writing a protobuf extension that allows the number of bits to use for each data type to be defined with bindings for common programming languages.

Currently working on implementing a variable bit-stream for the languages intended to be supported - c, c#, rust, java and python, see the README.md in variable-streams for more information.
